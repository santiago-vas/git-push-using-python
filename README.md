# git-push-using-python

a super easy way to read a repositorie from github, in this case we have connected github with azure.
read a repo, create a file and manipulate it and finally put it inside the repo with a git.push function()

is very important to consider the names of the repositorie while to go thrugh the code.

also the code works when you have username and password
